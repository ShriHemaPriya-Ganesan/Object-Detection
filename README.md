**Objectives**
* Gain an understanding of object detection models and their application using pre-trained deep learning architectures.
* Implement object tracking to follow objects across a sequence of images or video frames, integrating it with the detection model.
* Experiment with the model on a chosen dataset to observe its detection and tracking capabilities.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of the model in object detection and tracking, identifying challenges and discussing potential enhancements.

1. Research and Model Selection
Research: Explore various deep learning models widely recognized for object detection and tracking, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), and Faster R-CNN.
Model Selection: Select one pre-trained model for object detection based on its reported performance metrics, compatibility with your dataset, and real-time processing capabilities.

2. Data Collection and Preparation
Dataset: Identify or gather a dataset apt for object detection and tracking. This dataset can either be publicly available or self-compiled, provided it is adequately annotated for object detection tasks.
Preprocessing: Prepare your dataset for application. This may include resizing or filtering images if necessary, and normalizing pixel values to suit your chosen model's requirements.

4. Implementation
Object Detection: Implement the selected pre-trained object detection model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Object Tracking: Augment your object detection model with tracking functionality. Implement simple to advanced tracking algorithms based on your project's needs.
