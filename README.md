**Object Detection and Tracking with Deep Learning**
This project focuses on implementing object detection and tracking using deep learning models. The aim was to utilize a pre-trained object detection model to detect and locate objects within images or video streams, and then extend its functionality to track those objects across multiple frames. This offers a practical introduction to key concepts in object detection and tracking.

**Objectives**
•	Understand the application of object detection models using pre-trained deep learning architectures.
•	Implement object tracking to follow objects across frames and integrate it with the detection model.
•	Test the model's capabilities on a chosen dataset to observe its detection and tracking performance.
•	Evaluate the model’s effectiveness and discuss challenges or potential enhancements.

**Research and Model Selection**
Research: Explored popular object detection models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), and Faster R-CNN.
Model Selection: Chose a pre-trained model based on its performance, compatibility with the dataset, and real-time processing capability.

**Data Collection and Preparation**
Dataset: Identified or gathered a suitable dataset for object detection and tracking, ensuring it was properly annotated for object detection tasks.
Preprocessing: Prepared the dataset by resizing, filtering images, and normalizing pixel values to meet the requirements of the chosen model.

**Implementation**
Object Detection: Implemented the selected pre-trained object detection model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Object Tracking: Enhanced the model with tracking functionality, using basic or advanced tracking algorithms depending on the project's scope.
Documentation: Ensured the implementation was well-documented, with clear explanations of critical sections of code.

**Evaluation**
Deployment: Applied the model to the dataset, ensuring it was properly configured without the need for fine-tuning.
Performance Analysis: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP) for detection and Intersection over Union (IoU) for tracking.

**Analysis and Discussion**
Insights: Presented the results of the model’s performance with visual examples of detection and tracking in image sequences or video.
Challenges: Discussed any issues encountered during the project, including model performance limitations or dataset and computational constraints.
Future Directions: Proposed improvements to enhance the model’s object detection and tracking performance for future work.

This project serves as a solid foundation for exploring deep learning-based object detection and tracking systems, with practical insights into model selection, implementation, and evaluation.
